# Cognix v0.1.4 Release Notes

**Released**: September 5, 2025

## 🔧 Improvements

### Enhanced Reference Notation Reliability
- **Partial failure resilience** - Reference notation now continues processing when some files are found and others are missing
- **Improved error handling** - Clear, actionable error messages for missing files and functions
- **Better user guidance** - Helpful tips for correcting file names and function references

### System Stability
- **Robust error recovery** - System remains stable even when references fail
- **Enhanced context processing** - Better integration of valid content when partial references succeed
- **Optimized system prompts** - More effective AI analysis with referenced content prioritization

## 🛠 Technical Improvements

### Reference Notation Processing
- Fixed processing continuation when some referenced files exist but others don't
- Enhanced variable initialization to prevent undefined state errors
- Improved system prompt construction with proper content prioritization

### Multi-Model Compatibility
- Verified consistent behavior across Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4o
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing reference syntax
- Ensured stable performance across different AI providers

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Testing Coverage
- **Reference notation testing**: All combinations of file and function references
- **Error scenario testing**: Partial failures, complete failures, and mixed conditions
- **Model compatibility testing**: Verified across multiple AI models
- **Command functionality testing**: /run and /related commands thoroughly tested

### Verified Functionality
- Single and multiple file references work consistently
- Function reference notation operates correctly
- Mixed file and function references process properly
- Error messages provide clear guidance for resolution

## 🔍 Bug Fixes

- Fixed reference notation processor stopping on partial failures
- Resolved system prompt construction issues with referenced content
- Corrected variable scope issues in reference error handling
- Enhanced context text processing for better AI analysis

## 📋 Maintenance

### Code Quality
- Improved error handling patterns throughout reference processing
- Better separation of concerns in reference validation
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities
- Cleaner code organization for reference notation features

## 🚀 What's Working Well

### Stable Core Features
- All primary CLI commands functioning reliably
- Session management and memory persistence working correctly
- Model switching and provider management stable
- File execution and analysis tools operating properly

### Reference Notation Robustness
- Handles real-world scenarios with missing or renamed files
- Provides constructive feedback for reference errors
- Maintains system stability under error conditions
- Supports complex multi-file analysis workflows

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Improved Error Handling
```bash
# This now works gracefully even if one file is missing
cognix> @existing_file.py @missing_file.py Analyze both files
🔎 Processing references...
❌ File not found: missing_file.py
📁 File: existing_file.py (42 lines)
# ... continues with analysis of existing_file.py
```

### Robust Reference Processing
```bash
# Mixed references work reliably
cognix> @utils.py #helper_function Combine these for optimization
🔎 Processing references...
📁 File: utils.py (89 lines)
🔍 Function: helper_function (found in main.py)
# ... provides integrated analysis
```

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
No migration required. This update maintains full backward compatibility:
- All existing commands work unchanged
- Reference notation syntax remains the same
- Session files and memory are preserved
- Configuration settings unchanged

### Enhanced Workflows
Users will notice improved reliability when:
- Working with large codebases where files may be renamed
- Using reference notation in exploratory analysis
- Referencing functions across multiple files
- Dealing with incomplete project structures

## 🎯 Technical Details

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- No additional dependencies required
- Compatible with existing API key configurations

### Performance
- No significant performance impact
- Improved error processing efficiency
- Better memory usage during reference resolution

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
